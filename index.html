		<p class="space">Rhinoceros is a large animal with horns and thick skin. They are herbivores that means they eat only plants and fruits. Few animals like African and Asian Elephants are taller at the shoulder than the rhinoceros. The species of rhinoceros are Indian rhinoceros, white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, and many more species. The white and black rhinoceros are found in Africa while the Indian, the Javan, and the Sumatran rhinoceros are found in the Asian region. One interesting fact about rhinos is that they are known for their distinctive horns, which are actually made of keratinâ€”the same protein that makes up human hair and nails.  </p>
